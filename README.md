# TODO LIST

[?] Add different sprites for the different states of the segments
[X] add references to circular_genome and an ID to every segment
[X] make proteins insert into the genome
[X] Fix the direction in which TE segments spit out proteins
[X] make fitness sliders change with signals from TEs and CDS changes
[X] add a timer for the next generation
[ ] make the recognition be dependent on a sequence (red,green,blue?)
[ ] make new graphics for the genome (circle-line for the empty stuff)
[ ] Implement new generation
	[ ] copying the genome
	[ ] mutations (can eliminate TEs;)
	[ ] selection (replication dependent on fitness)
